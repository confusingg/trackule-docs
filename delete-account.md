# Account Deletion Request

We value your privacy and your right to control your data.

If you have created an account (to sync data across devices) and wish to permanently delete it along with all associated data, you have two options:

## Option 1: Delete from within the App (Recommended)
This is the fastest method and happens instantly.
1. Open the **Trackule** app.
2. Go to **Settings**.
3. Scroll down to the **Account** section.
4. Tap **Delete account**.
5. Confirm your choice. This will immediately wipe your data from our servers.

## Option 2: Request Deletion via Email
If you have uninstalled the app or cannot access it, you may request deletion by contacting us directly.

1. Email us at **hiya@trackule.com**.
2. Use the subject line: **Account Deletion Request**.
3. Please send the email **from the same email address** you used to sign up for Trackule.
   - *This is required for us to verify you own the account.*
4. We will process your request and delete your account and data within 30 days.

## What happens when I delete my account?
- All your tracked data (items, entries, history) will be permanently removed from our cloud servers.
- Your email address will be removed from our authentication database.
- This action is **irreversible**.
